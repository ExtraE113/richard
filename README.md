# Richard AKA Thing A Day

Thing A Day, "codenamed" Richard, is an iOS-first minimalist todo app made for Fergus Hammond. 
Among the ugliest code ever written but it gets the job done. First feature should be a refactor though.
Hopefully we can avoid having nested `futurebuilder`s but I'm not sure how (haven't looked into it yet).
That probably involves custom futures which shouldn't be too painful.
